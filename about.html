    The Black Flag real represents the absence of a flag. 
    This Flag reminds me of Black History Month or June 19th. 
    Juneteenth stands for the day slaves were released to be free. 
    The reason Juneteenth is special to us because, 
    slavery lasted for 400 years in the United State which is alot of years which now is more than 1,000 years ago.
     The Black Flag came from Hermosa Beach, California.
     The colors on the Flag stands for diffrent meanings/Reasonings.
